Brainfk++ is a low-level programming language comprised of 22 instructions, with each instruction represented by a character. It expands on the work of Urban M√ºller by introducing more instructions, therby allowing you to easily work with a large amount of data and interface with various I/O.
# Brainfk++ Instruction Set
| Instruction | Description | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Increment current cell value by 1. | - |
| - | Decrement current cell value by 1. | - |
| < | Move pointer left by 1 cell.| - |
| > | Move pointer right by 1 cell.| - |
| [ | If **currentCellValue** == 0, goto cell after corresponding ']' instruction. | currentCellValue |
| ] | If **currentCellValue** != 0, goto cell after corresponding '[' instruction. | currentCellValue |
| , | Take input and set current and following cells to either (left, right, up, down, enter) (**mode** == 0) or (analogInput1, analogInput2, enter) (**mode** == 1). | mode |
| . | Output **currentCellValue** as an integer (**mode** == 0), character (**mode** == 1), or custom character (**mode** == 2) at character (**x**, **y**) on display, or clear the display (**mode** == 3). | currentCellValue, mode, x, y |
| ? | Set the value of the current cell to random integer from 0 to **maximumIntegerValue**. | maximumIntegerValue |
| ! | Play a tone with a note value of **note** and a duration of (**duration** / 10) seconds. | note, duration |
| : | Output **currentCellValue** as an integer (**mode** == 0), character (**mode** == 1), or custom character (**mode** == 2) over serial, output **additionalValue** as an integer over serial, and wait for response (integer, character, or input) (**expectResponse** == 1). | currentCellValue, mode, additionalValue, expectResponse |
| ~ | Pause for (**duration** / 10) seconds. | duration |
| ^ | Set the cell pointer to **currentCellValue**. | currentCellValue |
| = | Set the value of current cell to value of cell at **cellIndexNumber**. | cellIndexNumber |
| # | Set the value of the current cell to either 0 (**currentCellValue** != 0) or 1 (**currentCellValue** == 0). | currentCellValue |
| ‚ñè| Set the value of the current cell to either 0 (**currentCellValue** < 0) or 1 (**currentCellValue** > -1). | currentCellValue |
| @ | If global PIN has been set and is correct, execute program at **programIndexNumber**. | programIndexNumber |
| * | Concatenate cell array and program arrays (**mode** == 0) or do not clear cell memory when program is finished (**mode** == 1). | mode |
| ; | Set the value of the buffer cell to **currentCellValue**. | currentCellValue |
| _ | Set the value of the current cell to the value of the buffer cell. | - |
| & | Set the value of the current cell to (**currentCellValue** * 10). | currentCellValue |
| " | Skip the next instruction. | - |
